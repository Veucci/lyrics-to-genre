    When I'm away from you, I'm happier than ever Wish I could explain it
    better I wish it wasn't true Give me a day or two to think of something
    clever To write myself a letter To tell me what to do, mm-mmm Do you read
    my interviews? Or do you skip my avenue? (My avenue) When you (when you)
    said you were passing through Was I even on your way? I knew when I asked
    you to (when I asked you to) Be cool about what I was telling you You'd do
    the opposite of what you said you'd do (what you said you'd do) And I'd
    end up more afraid Don't say it isn't fair You clearly weren't aware that
    you made me miserable So if you really wanna know

    Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings But I'm
    only going to get this one chance (six minutes, six minutes) Something's
    wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
    Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't
    know what If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big
    trouble And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances You
    are just what the doctor ordered I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap
    God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now who thinks
    their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? They said I rap like a
    robot, so call me Rapbot

    Come as you are, as you were As I want you to be As a friend, as a friend
    As an old enemy Take your time, hurry up Choice is yours, don't be late
    Take a rest as a friend As an old Memoria, memoria Memoria, memoria Come
    doused in mud, soaked in bleach As I want you to be As a trend, as a
    friend As an old Memoria, memoria Memoria, memoria
  example_title: (Rock) Come as You Are - Nirvana
